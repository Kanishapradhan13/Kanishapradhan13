# Topic: HACK THE BOX Tier0,1
----

### what is hack the box 
Hack The Box is an online platform that gives us access to various types of virtual machines, challenges, and environments for practicing penetration testing and ethical hacking in a safe manner

### How can you access the machine 
To access the machine, I first downloaded openvpn and then downloaded the VPN configuration file from the "Access" of starting point section and set up the VPN by running the following command on my terminal.

> sudo openvpn starting_point_Kanisha1330.ovpn

The starting point is now active.

### Meow machine
After connecting the starting point I then spwaned the Meow machine and got the Ip address of the machine. 

Ip address = 10.129.90.203

TASK 3

What service do we use to form our VPN connection into HTB labs?
- openvpn 
we used it to connect to the virtual machine

TASK 4

What tool do we use to test our connection to the target with an ICMP echo request?
- ping
we can use it to ping the target ip address and the target machine responds.

TASK 5

What is the name of the most common tool for finding open ports on a target?
- nmap
Network mapper is tool to find what ports are open on the target machine.

TASK 6

What service do we identify on port 23/tcp during our scans?
- to find what service is running we can run the following command 

> nmap -sV 10.129.90.203 

This will give us the answer as Telnet.

TASK 7

What username is able to log into the target over telnet with a blank password?
- root 

SUBMIT FLAG
