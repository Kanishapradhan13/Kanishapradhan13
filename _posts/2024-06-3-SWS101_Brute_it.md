- Privilege escalation

### Nmap

There are 2 open ports.

    22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 
    80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 

### Brute-force

Here i used the fuff tool to find the hidden files.

![fuff](/assets/img/image7.png)

There are 3 directories

- admin
- index.html
- server-status

Navigating to the admin page i found this login page where i found a source code.

![admin](/assets/img/image8.png)

![admin1](/assets/img/image9.png)

The souce code says that the username is admin.

Now to find the password we'll use hydra.

I found the password as xavier

![flag](/assets/img/webflag.png)

After successful Login, We get the Web Flag and an RSA Private key. Using this RSA key we can attempt to Login via SSH since Port 22 on the target is open.

Now to crack the hash i used this tool

![rsahash](/assets/img/image12.png)

    hashcat -m 22931 -a 0 hash_rsa_key.txt rockyou.txt

using this command we cracked the hash and found the password to be rockinroll

As i know the username and the password I can login to the machine using ssh.

![login](/assets/img/image14.png)

after successfully logging in i have listed the files and got the user.txt file and read it it get the user flag.
