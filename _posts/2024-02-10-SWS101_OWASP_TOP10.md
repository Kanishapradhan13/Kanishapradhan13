## Topic: OWASP TOP 10 - 2021

### Introduction 

This room breaks each OWASP topic down and includes details on the vulnerabilities, how they occur, and how you can exploit them.

### accessing the machine 

To begin with the rooms we first have to start the machine.

###  Broken Access Control

Broken access controls allow attackers to bypass the authorization process, granting them the ability to not only view sensitive data they shouldn't be able to see, but also perform actions and access parts of the site that should be restricted only for authorized users like yourself. It's a serious security problem that can make your website vulnerable.

### Broken Access Control (IDOR:Insecure Direct Object Reference Challenge) 

Imagine you have a website that stores information about different users. Each user's information is like a private folder that only they and authorized people (like an admin) should be able to access.

An IDOR vulnerability happens when the website isn't properly checking who is trying to access which user's folder. It's like having a bunch of lockers with people's names on them, but anyone can open any locker simply by changing the name on the door.
