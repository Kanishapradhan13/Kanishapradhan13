# what we learned in the flipped class

In our second flipped class we studied on ER data models. What I learned in this class is that ER data models are like maps used for organizing data for a database. For example, if you're organizing stuffs in your room, like books, shoes, and clothes, you need a plan to keep everything tidy and easy to find. That's what the Entity-Relationship (ER) data model is for databases. It deals with "things" called entities, which could be anything tangible. Each entity has its own set of details, or Attributes, like clothes' color,size and pattern, or a book's title, author, and publication year. There are Relationships between these things. For instance, a student might borrow books from the library. That's a connection between the "student" and "book" entities. In the ER diagram, we draw lines between these entities to show how they interact. This shows us how things are related. There could also be relationships like a customer booking a bus ticket , or patients making appointments for a consultation with a doctor.ER diagram helps database designers plan how to store and retrieve information easily and quickly. Just like arranging your stuff in your room makes it easier to find things when you need them, organizing data in a database using the ER model makes it simpler to manage and understand the data.

# what we did during the flipped class 

During the second flipped class we got divided into 6 groups of 4 members each and were given a topic to make an ER diagram for.First we detected all the entities for the topic we were given that was "Online health book(E-health)- Patient Health Records". The entities were 1.patients, 2.Appointment 3.Medication 4.Doctor 5.Medical condition. We discussed the attributes for each entity and the relationship between them. We were then asked to create the ER diagram in the chart paper and present it to the whole class.

# what improvements should be made 

I think that during the group discussions every one should participate and contribute their points with the group members.
