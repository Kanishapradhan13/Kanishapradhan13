### Topic: Database users and Database administrators
----

In our first flipped class we learned about the types of Database users and the roles and responsibilities of Database administrators, with each of their definitions.Database users are the people working with the database.Database administrators are the people in-charge of the database. There are 7 different types of database users, they are naive users, system analysts, sophisticated users, database designers, application programmers, casual users, and specialized users.Naive users are those who don't have any DBMS knowledge but frequently use the database applications in their daily life. Example for naive users would be the usage of ticket booking applications. System analysts are those who fulfills the database requirements for the naive users. Sophisticated users are those who have the knowledge of the database and can create their own application. Database designers are those who design the structure of the database like tables and views. They are also responsible for understanding the requirements of different users and create the design. Application programmers are the backend programmers who writes the code for the application. Casual users are those who occasionally access the database but requires new information each time they use it. Specialized users are the those who write specialized database application codes. Database Administrators are responsible for managing relationship with vendors and service providers. The also look after the functionality of the database such as backup and recovery of lost datas, granting access of the database to the users and making the database run faster by planning how data is stored and searched. 

In our first flipped class we were divided into 4 groups of 6 members each of which the first two groups were assigned to learn about database users and the other two groups were assigned to learn about the roles and responsibilities of database administrators. We were given 30 mins to discuss the topics in our home groups and later we were assigned groups with different members from each groups to share the information we had learned about previously. We were then asked to share our understandings from the discussion by our tutor.

Flipped classes are more of a student focused approach of learning. I think that it would be better to sometimes let the students learn through watching online lectures and learning outside the classroom which will give us exposure to new materials and learning at our own pace.
