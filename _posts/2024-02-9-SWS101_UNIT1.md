# Topic: Networking
----

### Before learning about networking, i thought internet was a 
- storage of information used for research purposes, learning and staying informed about various topics.
- a means of communicating with people and staying connected with friends and family regardless of geographical location.
- and also for entertainment purposes.

### What i thought WIFI/hotstop was that:
- WIFI is a network connection like internet but it can used without needing a SIM.
- hotstop is a sharing of internet with another device, which works like a internet for the other device.

### what is a public network.
It is a network connection accessible to general public.
Examples of a public network are:
- Internet
- WI-Fi 

Internet is a public network used to communicate with people all over the world through various services.

Wi-Fi is a public wireless network which allows people to access the internet without a wired connection.

### what is a private network.
A private network is a network connection that is restricted in access and is usually limited to specific users, organizations, or devices. Private networks are often used to protect sensitive information or resources.
Examples of private network are:
- Local Area Networks (LANs)
- Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

Local Area Networks (LANs): LANs are private networks secured in a specific geographical area, such as an office, campus, or home. They allow connected devices within the network to communicate and share resources and internet access.

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): VPNs create secure connections over public networks, like the  Internet, to establish private communication channels between users or networks.

### what is NAT
NAT, or Network Address Translation, is like a translator for computers on the internet. Imagine your home network is like a big house party with lots of guests (devices like phones, computers, tablets). Now, think of your internet connection as the door to your house party. 

- Conservation of IP Addresses: Just like if you had only one name tag for multiple guests at the party, NAT lets all your devices share one "name tag" (public IP address) when they go outside to the internet. This saves space and helps make sure we don't run out of name tags. 

- Enhanced Security: NAT also acts like a bouncer at the door. It hides the names (IP addresses) of your devices inside the party from people outside. So, if someone from outside tries to snoop around, they only see the main entrance (public IP address), not who's inside. 

- Simplification of Routing: Think of NAT as your party's organizer. When someone from inside wants to talk to someone outside, NAT helps by making sure their message gets to the right place and comes back to the right person. It's like having one person represent the whole party when talking to people outside. 

So, NAT basically helps keep your party (network) organized, safe, and makes sure everyone can communicate even when there's only one door (public IP address) to the outside world. 

### what is DNS 
The Domain Name System (DNS) is basically a directory of domain names (like "google.com" or "facebook.com") and their IP addresses on the internet. It acts as a translator, converting human-friendly domain names into computer-friendly IP addresses, making it easier for devices to communicate with each other through internet.
